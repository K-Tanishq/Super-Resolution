# Image Super Resolution Using SR-GANs and SR-ResNet

## Problem Statement
The problem of image super-resolution (SR) involves the process of transforming a low-resolution image into a high-resolution counterpart. This task is inherently ill-posed, as the same low-resolution image can correspond to multiple high-resolution images. The challenge is to generate a high-resolution image that is as close as possible to the original, high-resolution image, based on the limited information present in the low-resolution input.

## Methodology
We have used two different approaches to tackle this problem. First of them being SR-ResNet (Super Resolution ResNet) and second being SR-GANs (Super Resoltion GANs). Since it is a task of generating the unknown pixels in the lower resolution image to generate a higher resolution image therefore we have used GANs since we know it's ability to give excellent results in generative tasks.
